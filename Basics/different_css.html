        <p>Belly Conklin spends every summer at Cousins Beach with her mom, brother, and the Fisher family, a tradition that has shaped her childhood. But one summer, everything changesâ€”Belly finds herself no longer seen as a little kid, and she becomes caught in a complicated love triangle between brothers Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher. As she navigates first love, shifting friendships, heartbreak, and family struggles, Belly learns about growing up, loss, and what it really means to find herself.</p>
