            <h1> First Thanksgiving</h1>
            <p>The First Thanksgiving happened in 1621 in Plymouth. After a hard winter, the Pilgrims had a successful harvest thanks to the help of the Wampanoag people. To celebrate, the Pilgrims and about 90 Wampanoag men held a three-day feast with foods like corn, squash, and venison. This gathering is remembered as the First Thanksgiving./p>

            <h1>The Pilgrims' Hard Winter</h1>
            <p>The Pilgrims’ hard winter happened in 1620–1621 after they arrived in Plymouth. They faced freezing weather, little food, and diseases like scurvy. Because of these harsh conditions, about half of the Pilgrims died. The survivors struggled until spring, when the Wampanoag people began helping them learn how to live in the new land.</p>

         <div class="card">
            <h1>Wampanoag Assistance</h1>
            <p>The Wampanoag Assistance refers to how the Wampanoag people helped the Pilgrims survive after their hard winter. They taught the Pilgrims how to plant corn, fish, and find local foods. Their leader, Massasoit, also formed a peace agreement with the Pilgrims. Without the Wampanoag’s help, the Pilgrims likely would not have survived.</p>
