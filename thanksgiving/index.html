            <h2>What is Thanksgiving?</h2>
            <p>Thanksgiving is a holiday centered around gathering with loved ones, sharing a comforting meal, and taking time to appreciate the meaningful parts of life. Families and friends often come together around a table filled with dishes like turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, vegetables, and different kinds of pies, though every household has its own unique recipes and traditions. Along with the meal, many people spend the day relaxing, watching football games, enjoying parades, or simply catching up with people they don’t see often. Others use the break to travel, reconnect, or start preparing for the winter holidays. The celebration isn’t focused on historical origins as much as it is on enjoying togetherness, expressing gratitude, and creating a peaceful pause from busy routines. It’s a time when people slow down, reflect on what matters to them, and enjoy the warmth and comfort of being surrounded by those they care about.</p>

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>Thanksgiving is important because it is a time to give thanks for the good things in life, like family, friends, and food, while also reflecting on personal and community blessings. It brings people together, strengthening relationships and creating shared memories through traditions like cooking, sharing meals, watching parades, and football games. Historically, it commemorates the 1621 harvest feast between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people, symbolizing cooperation and gratitude. Beyond celebration, it encourages generosity and kindness, inspiring people to help others in need. Overall, Thanksgiving reminds us to appreciate what we have, connect with loved ones, and reflect on both our personal and cultural history.</p>
